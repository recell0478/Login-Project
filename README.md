# Login-Project

This is a project where I experiment to use MySQL to create a basic login and register web application. In this project, I used tail-wind CSS and React for the front end and Express.js and MySQL for the backend. It is not fully funcitional but through this project I've learned to create a full-stack application.# Login Project

This project is my exploration into building a basic login and registration web application using **MySQL**. Through this hands-on experience, I learned how to create a full-stack application while experimenting with key technologies for both the frontend and backend. 

Although the application is not fully functional yet, it reflects my progress in developing a deeper understanding of full-stack development concepts.
